# Deploy the MOCK-ONLY build to the SE cluster. The first deploy of each app is OWNER-APPROVED: this script refuses to
# run unless OWNER_APPROVED=1 is set by the owner. It never builds or pushes an image; it applies manifests for an image
# that already exists in the registry.

# SE_HOST is a name two labels below the cluster's wildcard (for example gateway-claims.<cluster-host>): the cluster's external-dns creates
# its DNS record from the ingress, and cert-manager issues its certificate through CLUSTER_ISSUER. Both can take a few minutes.
#
# After the deploy (not done by this script): verify by CONTENT, not 200 (GET /api/info must say {mode:mock, simulated:true, hosted:true}),
# check the registry manifest and the pod's imageID match IMAGE, and hand over the full https:// URL after browser proof.
